We brought people from the Justice Department to come in and help us. And little by little we were able to move forward. We finally got an office. We were able to get space in which we could then function, and then we had a chance to look at the law and decide what is it that we're going to do. We were fortunate as I said that we had a lot of experience on the issue of equal employment opportunity on the other subjects except on on sex. So there was a lot of precedence set and we used that. We each also had to take assignments. If you read the law, you will find that there is really no role for the other four commissioners.

    "text": "I think there were two big issues. One was what was going on in the body politic, and I think we were beginning to see from the opinion polls that an outright victory for Mr. Cameron and the Conservatives was going to be very difficult. It had always been that simply because of the huge majorities that Mr. Blair had built up before before Gordon Brown took over. So there was something going on out there that was going to make the election of 2010 the more interesting. And I think that there was within that a growing sense in the electorate that they weren't simply going to take an old-fashioned campaign and leaders standing there and just handing out edicts, as it were. They wanted something different, something fresher. And the second thing was that when the debates were agreed, which I think in some respects were a reflection of that, that the leaders themselves knew they had to get out there and drill deeper down into the mindset of the electorate, was this enormous responsibility that the BBC, ourselves, and Sky would have, because it was always going to have to be the three, there was no doubt about that. The fact that we went first was literally the luck of the draw, they drew out numbers. And so that just added to the responsibility. So yeah, you're absolutely right in the question. One, something very different and interesting was going on out there, and secondly, suddenly we had this crucial role to play within it.",

    "text": "Curiously enough, the responsibility was awesome, and just getting it right and not getting tongue-tied and not screwing up the rules of engagement were the toughest challenges. So journalistically, the challenge was fairly modest because the questions were written by members of the public, the questions were asked by members of the public, the rules precluded my saying, well, hang on a minute, that's not what you said back in 2008. I wasn't allowed to do that. It would have been quite fun to do it, but that was not the nature of the debate. The debate was simply to enable ordinary people to put ordinary questions, which I thought on reflection were very, very good questions. We selected the ten from about 200. So there was a journalistic influence at that point, but I think it was a fairly intelligent and balanced selection of questions. My biggest challenges were all logistical. It was to make sure that these three big figures, um, all of whom I knew and all of whom I respected, uh but you know, they were one was a outgoing Prime Minister and was still Prime Minister until he lost or won the election. The other two were the two who wanted to be Prime Minister, as it were. So they're big beasts to be dealing with. Um and I had to keep them rigidly to one minute first time, one minute second time, and then four and a half, five minutes when it was open debate. And within that open debate, I also had to rigidly balance it so we didn't get too much of Cameron or too much of Clegg or not enough of Brown. So it was a kind of timekeeping ringmaster job rather than a journalistic one. But but that's quite an awesome challenge. I think it is 99% certain that we will have debates again before the 2015 election.",

And that's that was the other reason I wanted, apart from to say thank you to GB News, quite genuinely, was to publicly say that the NHS is out there. It's having a tough time. I don't support the strikes, I'm very upset by the strikes. Um, but those who've still been working, who've been looking after me GP nurses, um uh occupational therapy, the consultants, have all been utterly brilliant. Although one of the consultants phoned up the other day of an evening just to say, Are you okay, everything all right? And don't forget you're coming to see us on Tuesday or whatever. And my wife said, Aren't you supposed to be on strike?",

    "text": "Just yeah, just so that I'll remember what am I doing tomorrow. But when it's things that really matter, like medical appointments. Sal, bless her heart, does all of that. So if if the GP furns up or one of the consultants or a letter comes saying, you know, you're due to come and see us for X, Y, or Z, then I just hand over the letter or the phone to Sal, because obviously that's something that that's important and and that that I don't want to get wrong and I can't afford to get wrong. So very, very short-term memory is tricky. Motor skills definitely tricky. One of the things, fortunately, which if you read all the literature on it, uh, it talks about spatial awareness. So things like I remember thinking spatial awareness. I was worried that when the floor manager, brilliant, another Camilla, brought me in, you know, make sure you don't trip over. Well, uh, if Lavrov can trip up on his way to go and meet Moody, uh, and Biden can trip up on the way down about, yeah. I'm in good company if that happens. But I haven't had that spatial awareness problem at all. One weird thing is old-fashioned clocks. So if I glance down at a digital clock, that's not a problem. Um, but if I glance down at this one, old-fashioned analog one, or the big one in the kitchen at home, it sometimes takes me a while. Or if I I'm not allowed to set it anymore because I always get it wrong. Uh, and that digital clocks are brilliant, and that that's much better. So that's a perception thing that w whatever little bit of my brain looks at and says, right, if the big hand's there and the little one's there, it's eight o'clock or whatever. That's obviously had a stroke at some stage.",

You might also be interested to note that in his later life he became very distressed about evil because basically he was confronted with the choice are things Good, because God says so. Or does God approve of them because they were good and he couldn't see the way out of any way other than saying that absolute power is its own justification, as Calvin and others said. And in view of the fact that the traditional religion is committed to the idea that most of God's creatures are going to be tortured forever for the things that He makes them do, the whole of Christian theism is a nightmare to me. And one of the reasons why I am so concerned about these arguments, because I see the existence of the Christ as a nightmare. Because far from being good, the on the actual record, and if you say only Calvinists believe this, I can refer you to the passages in Aquinas where he says that God created people and is the ultimate cause of including the behavior for which he is proposing to torture them forever.",

Uh most of them called them savages, and whenever they uh fought back it was a massacre. Uh and when the blue coats fought, uh they were the heroes. So uh the motion pictures have done a job on ethnic groups, and certainly even the blacks going back to the motion picture birth of a nation, if you remember that one back in the s in in the early part of the century. And then the Arabs, uh, same thing. Belly dancers, bombers, and billionaires. Uh you mention Arab, you hear terrorists, and that's and that's what in the past 70 years Hollywood has happened has managed to do to the image of Arabs. And and really in most recent history, the uh the conflict that w well one hand we are through with a piece of it, I don't think we're through necessarily in the Middle East, uh brings this fear up again with people.

But at STL Reeves recognized that the optical frequency as a carrier wave should be exploited as early as possible. So he started the work of using optical signal generated by a hollowed cathode tube, which has a very small spot, very bright spot of light generated as a plasma. And they were already doing experiments for optical communications. And so when I joined the work was started, but I was not directly involved, but I'm peripherally involved because the two labs are working very closely. By 1963,",

And he said, Oh we do it as quick as we can here and we and we shot the scene in about three or four takes. He was a hard taskmaster to work for, but a l lovely guy, I loved him. I I got on got on very, very well with him. And then of course, you know, that that came out in 1971, I think it was. And luckily for me, George Lucas saw it because it was out very, very briefly, you know, because it was uh it created a a lot of bad publicity, you know, over the content of the film. And um uh anyway, uh I said Lucas saw in the very brief period that it was out and then remembered me for five years and then came and came to London and um set himself up in the 20th century Fox offices in London, central London, and got in touch with the managing director and said, Look, do me a favor, can you can you find me this guy Dave Price? And uh and then I got called in and I said to him, I said, Well how you know, how did you know of me? And he said, Oh, he said, Oh, you're corkered orange. So if you're good enough for Stanley Kubrick, you're good enough for me, like you know, and that was it. That was uh and there we go, became Darth Vader. Yeah, yeah.",

    "text": "When I heard a story in NPR about our troops in Afghanistan and Iraq, and they said they're there for for about uh six months, and the Department of Defense brings them back for two weeks, what they call RR, rest and recuperation with their family. Then they go back and they finish their year. The next part of the story I heard I couldn't believe they said the Department of Defense is bringing them back to the East Coast, putting them down in Baltimore, Atlanta, and they're told from here, you pay your own way home, and by the way, be back in two weeks, and we can get you back to Iraq. I didn't believe it, and I had my staff check, and it was true. I filed a bill about two weeks later to require the Department of Defense to pay the domestic travel. And every time I file a new bill, I do what's called a dear colleague letter. And within 10 days, two weeks, I had 138 co-sponsors, Republicans and Democrats, signed on this bill. And I wrote a note across the top of my dear colleague letter in blue pen and said, Dear Mr. President, I know you care about our troops, please make this happen to this morning. I said, Stuck in my pocket, and we went over to the White House Christmas party, and I saw a guy named Don Rumsfeld, and I walked over to him and I said, Mr. Secretary Dennis Warren, talk for a minute. And I reached in my pocket and handed him this letter and he said, What is this? And I told him, he said, I said, I would really appreciate it if you could help me get this done for our troops. And he said, Let me see what I can do and I'll get back with you. He never called me back, never wrote me back, but two weeks after I talked to him, he incorporated my bill into the Defense Department budget retroacted in September 1101, just like I'd written, it's now law. And that really felt good. And I I had two, in fact, back home, two uh members of the Army come up to me and thank me for doing the bill, and they said, you know, I didn't even come back from Iraq because I knew we didn't have the money to get home. This is before my bill became law. And they stayed in Iraq. And that's just horrible that we would do something like that to our people.",

You know what happened after that with the hiders, etc. Today I am honored, and I mean honored, by the presence here of the man whom I've been hating at long distance for some time, the David Suzuki. David, surely to God there's room for both logging and the irreplaceable environment on parts of South Moresby, this jewel and our crime and our crown on the Pacific coast. No, I'm talking we're talking now about British Columbia as a whole. Within British Columbia, there is no question, logging is and will always remain an important part of our economy. However much we go for high technology and all that stuff, natural resources will always be an important part of our economy. The question is are there any pristine areas? Areas that might be left aside intact as a hedge against our ignorance? Do you think we know everything? Do you think we know enough to be able to manage our resources and replace the likes of what we're cutting down? Do you really think that? I think we have known enough to realize, said he, putting on his redneck hat, that the prosperity of British Columbia, and we'll all blame the companies for how they did it, where they did it, and when they did it, has depended almost entirely on the logging and lumber industry. This is 1987 Jack. Without it, even those parts that people want to take away from Lyle Island, we're going to be in a an even lower, more miserable winter of our discontent. Oh come on. The amount of logging that this represents is a minuscule part of the total loggable area of British Columbia. We're talking you're acting as if this little area, which represents what? 65 jobs? Is that what it represents? That's all it represents at the moment. And How many jobs are there in logging all across the province? across the province in logging and lumbering, there's about 25,000 jobs. What is all what is this is a minuscule number of jobs?",

    "text": "Oh, definitely, definitely. I don't think this says that. I don't think it says that all major or even small town newspapers must become part of chains or a larger corporation. A good example here is your fine paper in San Diego, which everyone has been trying to buy for years, including the Times Mirror Company. And they've all been rebuffed, and I think it's a wonderful thing that the union has remained in the cop in Helen Copley's hands. There has been for 20, 25 years amalgamations between newspapers and newspaper groups. You have the Knight Ritter, you have the formation of Gannett from practically us one small paper into the largest number of papers. So it's been going on for a long time. So I I think there's uh certainly a place for small or medium size or even large independently owned newspapers and magazines and television and so on. But I think what this was was an opportunity for the Times Mirror Company to place itself with a company very much like our like ours. The Tribune Company has a culture, a history. Um their products and services uh complement ours. They're in newspapers. We're no longer in television and they have twenty-two television stations, five radio stations, and they've done a superb job, which we haven't done. In connecting with the internet and and really seeing how far you can go with content from your television and your newspapers on the internet. We have not we have not done a good job. I'm very critical of our current management because they haven't done it in the last five years. In fact, they've downsized the company and sold off sold off books and magazines and so on. No, I I think there's a place for independent uh newspapers, and I hope they continue. But this was such a unique opportunity to place ourselves in the in the hands and work with a very fine company that we know. The markets work together.

And uh very frankly, uh we were going downhill under our current management. And uh I could see it going downhill, and I think this was a chance to put our company, which is not as strong as it was, together with an almost equally sized company, a unique opportunity, it'd probably never come along again.",

    "text": "What has changed the most? Satellites would be the first thing that I would say, because, you know, we have an awful lot of people, and this started years ago. It's not just me, but this started years ago where people liked to watch the games on television and listen to them on the radio. Carolina, when I was in the late 1950s during the run, the perfect run by the 57 team, a 32-0, WNC-TV was asked to start putting some of those games on the air. Well, the first one they put on the air, they didn't put it on the air, but they put it on the air. And they had audio with it, play-by-play audio. And the radio stations, there were no set networks back in those days. There were a lot of radio stations that went around and broadcasted an assortment of college basketball games. They'd be in Chapel Hill, say, on a Wednesday night, and on Thursday night they might be in Raleigh. Saturday night they might be in Durham or Old Wake Forest, where the Deacons were playing at that time before they moved to Winston-Salem. And so there were a lot of people, and all those radio stations, they really got mad. And I can tell you, you know, I've been to a lot of those radio stations, and I can understand why, because here was public television, the state-owned educational station on the campus of the University of North Carolina, coming in and taking audience away from them. So they had a quick meeting, and they allowed as to how WNC-TV would televise other games, but they would only televise the video, and they would put natural sound behind it. And they would run streamers across the bottom of the screen telling people to get the audio. They had to tune into the audio. They had to tune into their favorite radio station carrying the game. And so that worked very, very well for everybody concerned. And they called it broad vision. And so when satellites came along, people would still like to do that because they felt like we had a better feel and knew more about, say, the Tar Heels than television announcers did coming in and just, you know, being here less than a day and then trying to do the game. And so they wanted to hear the games while they watched them. Well, satellites made that difficult to do because a lot of times the radio audio, because we had only one satellite jump, was getting there well ahead of the television picture, which had two and sometimes three satellite jumps. And so satellite is the big change. And then, of course, before that, it was, you know, videotape. And now there's hardly any place we can go that we can't do things with wireless microphones and that sort of thing. So the electronic end of the business has really been in the big change through all these years. Yeah. Do you think you could have imagined any of this stuff when you started? I don't think so, particularly not the satellites, you know. And now to see high definition and they need two tractor trailer units to come in to give you high definition. But high definition is probably going to have the greatest impact on televised sports than anything else because it really does. I mean, you've talked about before being in the game. That's what high definition does. High definition really puts you in the game. And as long as professional teams and college teams, for that matter, see fit to keep raising ticket prices, I'm concerned about what the impact on what the revenue that particularly college teams need to generate. For example, at Carolina, football and basketball needs to generate a lot of revenue because they are basically supporting 26 other varsity teams.",

If I was to go back to the dawning of it all, I guess I'd have to start with Buddy Holly. Buddy died when I was about 18 and he was 22. From the moment I first heard him, I felt akin. I felt related, like he was an older brother. I even thought I resembled him. Buddy played the music that I loved, the music I grew up on, country western, rock and roll, and rhythm and blues.

I could make it all connect and move with the current of the day. When I started writing my own songs, the folk lingo was the only vocabulary that I knew, and I used it. But I had something else as well. I had principles and sensibilities and an informed view of the world, and I had had that for a while. Learned it all in grammar school. Don Quixote, Ivanhoe, Robinson Crusoe, Gulliver's Travels, Tales of Two Cities, all the rest. Typical grammar school reading that gave you a way of looking at life, an understanding of human nature, and a standard to measure things by. I took all that with me when I started composing lyrics, and the themes from those books worked their way into many of my songs, either knowingly or unintentionally. I wanted to write songs unlike anything anybody ever heard, and these themes were fundamental. Specific books that have stuck with me ever since I read them way back in grammar school. I want to tell you about three of them. Moby Dick, All Quiet on the Western Front, and The Odyssey. Moby Dick is a fascinating book, a book that's filled with scenes of high drama and dramatic dialogue. The book makes demands on you. The plot is straightforward. The mysterious Captain Ahab, captain of a ship called the Pequod, an egomaniac with the peg leg, pursuing his nemesis, the great white whale Moby Dick, who took his leg, and he pursues him all the way from the Atlantic, around the tip of Africa, and into the Indian Ocean. He pursues the way around both sides of the earth. It's an abstract goal, nothing concrete or definite. He calls Moby the Emperor, sees him as the embodiment of evil. Ahab's got a wife and child back in Nantucket that he reminisces about now and again. You can anticipate what will happen. The ship's crew is made up of men of different races, and any one of them who sights the whale will be given the reward of a gold coin. A lot of zodiac symbols, religious allegory, stereotypes. Ahab encounters other waving vessels, presses the captain for details about Moby. Have they seen him? There's a crazy prophet, Gabriel, on one of the vessels, and he predicts Ahab's doom. Says Moby is the incarnate of a Shaker God, and that any dealings with him will lead to disaster. He says that to Captain Ahab. Another ship's captain, Captain Boomer, he lost an arm to Moby, but he tolerates that and he's happy to have survived. He can't accept Ahab's lust for vengeance. This book tells how different men react in different ways to the same experience.",

But I had to figure out what it was. He couldn't articulate it or he didn't know how to. Nobody knew. But he wanted to do something that the space didn't allow him to do.

Three Little Birds, Them Belly Full, No Woman No Cry, This Is Love. Very well-known songs by the great idol, my dear too, I love Marley. There are 35 years of career, the 34th CD and the second DVD. After 10 years without working together, Gil celebrates the great stage singing next to his daughter, Nara Gil. She decided to sing again, after she gave birth. The son is already 11 years old, my grandson, João. And then she is... She is more free to... She spent these last years also working on my website, on the internet, attending, doing the maintenance of the site area, corresponding with people. And now she goes back to the singing experience. It's nice, she's nice, beautiful, she integrated well with Juju and Angela. They are doing the three vocals of the show. I'm very satisfied, she is too. I'm loving it, and it's a wonderful job, Bob Marley's songs. The show is amazing, super dancing, I'm loving it. So, it's worth checking it out. For sure, it's super good, Gil is singing like never before. It's a great tribute to Bob.",

There are seven states in the United States that have a fair wage where tipped workers earn the same minimum wage other workers do plus tips. If they grab your butt, if they say inappropriate things, you have to smile and put up with it or you literally will not be able to feed your children and pay your rent. And, you know, that proved to me, that is concrete proof that when there is pay equity and when women have more financial power, The federal mandated salary for a tipped worker is $2.13 an hour. I mean, you don't live on $2.13 an hour. It's restaurant workers, 13 million of them in the United States. And in those seven states, sexual harassment was cut in half. Eighty percent of them are women, often single mothers. And it just doesn't happen in the same way. we don't put up with it. She's suffering from PTSD. It all goes to taxes.

But human nature is such that you do want to do what others are doing. of money and pay a tenth of one percent for it would find some way to do But they go crazy occasionally on the asset side, and what they do is they start copying If anybody comes to me and says, we want to do this because the other guy is doing it, something profitable yeah but the the banks have always gotten in trouble on And they really haven't gotten in trouble too much on the expense side. the asset side they've never gotten in trouble on the liability side basically I say, go back to square one and come up with a better reason. But they do, and they copycat. I warn our managers against it all the time. costing around ten basis points now most people think you get a trillion dollars That's a great danger in any business. what their dumb competitors are doing.",
